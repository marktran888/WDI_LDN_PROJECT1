Battle snakes is a 2 player game.

Player 1 is red and uses keys: up(W) left(A) down(S) right(D).
Player 2 is blue and uses the arrow keys.

A player can win by being the first to reach 50 points or when the other player crashes.

Tip - a player can speed up by changing directions for example hitting right and up alternatively and repeatedly is faster than waiting for the snake to move by himself.

The snake gets faster and rocks will appear at random as the players accumulate points.
