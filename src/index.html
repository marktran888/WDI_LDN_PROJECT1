      <p> - Battle snakes is a 2 player game.</p>
      <p> - Player 1 is red and uses keys: up(W) left(A) down(S) right(D).</p>
      <p> - Player 2 is blue and uses the arrow keys.</p>
      <p> - A player wins points by eating the fruit that randomly appears.</p>
      <p> - A player can win by being the first to reach 50 points or when the other player crashes.</p>
      <p> - The snake gets faster and rocks will appear at random as the players accumulate points.</p>
      <p> - Tip - a player can speed up by changing directions for example hitting right and up alternatively and repeatedly is faster than waiting for the snake to move by himself.</p>
